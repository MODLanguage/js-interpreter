# MODL Typescript library

This library provides a TypeScript/JavaScript version of the MODL library.

The library is distributed as a CommonJS (CJS), ES module (ESM) and Universal Module Definition (UMD) file along with the TypeScript typings. These are all available by installing the library as a dependency.

## Installation

The library has been tested with Node 10.14, but may be compatible with older versions.

Add the library as a dependency to your project via your preferred package manager, e.g.

```bash
npm install --save modl
```

or 

```bash
yarn add modl
```

## Using the library

*TODO*: Add instructions for TypeScript and JavaScript

## Developing the library itself

### Building the TypeScript code

To (re-)generate the Typescript basis of the MODL library, run the `grammar` npm script:

```bash
npm run grammar
```
